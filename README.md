BSQ : Find the biggest valid square in a map with obstacles

------------------------------------------------------------

This is my BSQ project done during my first year in Epitech.
The goal of the project is to find the biggest square of '.' (dots) in a map with obstacles (represented by 'o'), then print the map with the square (all dots from the square are represented by 'x').
You have only some system calls allowed (like open, read...).
It is pretty well optimised (It can still be improved) and pass 100% of the Epitech tests (biggest map is 10000x10000).
